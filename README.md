Introduction:
This project uses data analysis to predict the impact of a player's age on their performance in baseball and to forecast a player's future performance based on their previous years' performance. The project is developed using Google Colab and several libraries such as Seaborn, Numpy, Math, Pandas, Warnings, Requests, Matplotlib.

Data Collection:
To begin, we will collect data from various sources such as baseball databases or websites that provide player statistics. This data includes various statistics for each player, such as their age, batting average, home runs, runs batted in, and other relevant statistics.

Data Cleaning and Pre-processing:
Once we have the data, the next step is to clean and pre-process it. This involves removing any missing or irrelevant data, converting data into the correct format, and creating new columns or variables that will be useful for analysis.

Data Exploration and Visualization:
Once the data is cleaned and pre-processed, we can begin exploring the relationships between different variables and how they impact player performance. This is done using various data visualization techniques, such as histograms, scatter plots, and line graphs, using the Seaborn library.

Age Impact Analysis:
We will use regression analysis to examine the relationship between player age and performance. This will help us determine if there is a significant impact of age on player performance and if so, how strong the impact is.

Future Performance Prediction:
We will use time series analysis to predict a player's future performance based on their previous years' performance. This will allow us to forecast how a player will perform in the future based on their past performance.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, this project provides a comprehensive analysis of how a player's age impacts their performance and how their previous years' performance can be used to predict their future performance. This project demonstrates the power of data analysis and the importance of using libraries such as Seaborn, Numpy, Math, Pandas, Warnings, Requests, Matplotlib in data analysis projects.
